# Mobile App Coding Challenge

## Introduction

Your challenge is to create a simple mobile app that calls an API with user input & displays the results.

## API

You can use any API you're familiar with that has a search feature & returns data. If you don't have an API, use this news API, which will
return news articles based on search text. See full documentation here at `https://newsapi.org/docs/get-started`

You can either sign up for your own API key, or use `c069630adc5c4fd893156917b7da614d`

## Mobile App

We use React here at Paid, ideally the solution should use React Native.

The app should:

* Display search box(s)
* Call the API on a button or key press (decide which one has the best UX)
* display the results so they can be fully read

## Requirements

1. Your App should call the API & display results
2. Create a Git repository in either Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket etc. Commit & push as you would normally, we expect to see at least a few
separate commits. Please share the url in the submission page
3. Please use Loom to record a short, 2-5 minutes high-level walk through for your solution covering the following points:
   * Your technology choices
   * Your app design
   * Demonstrate a few operations
   * Any improvements you would like to make

## Bonus points

If you finish within the time limit, feel free to address one or more of these items:

* Elegantly handle errors
* Improve the styling of the app
* Improve the usability of the app
* Store the history of searches
